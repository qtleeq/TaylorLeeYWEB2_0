## YWEB 2.0 Assignments

#### calculator.py

This calculator was initially generated by Github Copilot. I added the while loop so that the user could compute more calculations. I am thinking of moving the username input out of the loop so the user only has to enter their input once but the specification seems to indicate that the user should be prompted for their username each time.

#### joke.py

I was unable to run the script generated with Github Copilot on my Windows machine because it uses the `requests` module that is not in the standard library and must be installed with pip. I am better with Linux and I wrote a script that uses the joke api after reading an example online.

#### operator-precedence.py

I didn't use parentheses because I thought this would defeat the point of the exercise. Sorry I didn't have this done before Midnight last night; I had to go back into coursera to find it.
